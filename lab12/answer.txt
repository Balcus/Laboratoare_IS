1.  The program stores the value of p + 1 inside q
    Preconditions: p int, r int, r - p > 1
    Postconditions: q int, p < q < r

2.  Changing the method to q := p + 2 generates this error:
    ```
    Error: a postcondition could not be proved on this return path
    Could not prove: q < r
    This is assertion #1 of 3 in method between
    ```
    Counterexample: r = 3 , p = 1 ( 3 - 1 = 2 > 1 true)
                    q = 1 + 2 = 3
                    p < q < r => 1 < 3 < 3 false

3.  Changing the preconditions to r - p >= 1 generates this error:
    ```
    Error: a postcondition could not be proved on this return path
    Could not prove: q < r
    This is assertion #1 of 3 in method between
    ```
    Counterexample: r = 2, p = 1 (r - p = 2 - 1 = 1 >= 1)
                    q = p + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2
                    p < q < r => 1 < 2 < 2 (false)
